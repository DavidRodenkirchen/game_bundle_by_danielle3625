## <p align="center">  **Game Bundle Information!**

-This is the first project I have ever completed, after teaching myself Python via free online resources, purchased Udemy classes, and the StackOverflow website!

### Game_Launcher
- A program that serves as a menu to call the other module's (games) play function, and allows for replay functionality.
### Guessing Game
- The very first ever game I made after two weeks of studying Python!
- You will find this to be the mot basic of games offered, but 
### Tic Tac Toe
- A user vs computer tic tac toe match
- First attempt at a basic Try/Error message
### Blackjack
- User vs computer blackjack game. In this version, the player must purchase chips and place his bet. 
- This uses a little more extensive Try/Error message than before
- First foray into Classes!
### Battle
- In an effor to speed up gameplay, this game differs from the most common version by:
    - 2 facedown cards then 1 face up per round instead of 1 v 1
    - For battle: 4 facedown cards then 1 face up is used
